= Testcontainers - demo

Quite often when we are developing an application we need some external services such as a rabbitMQ, Kafka, ...
When developing locally you are quite likely using a docker compose file to start these up, and I am certainly (hopefully) not the only one that has forgotten at least once to start these instances up.

Luckily Spring Boot 3.1 introduced 2 nice new functionalities to make our live a bit easier.

. https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#features.docker-compose[Docker compose support] which allows us to make use of our compose.yaml file to start these up, and create the service connections for supported containers
. improved integration for testcontainers at development time which I'd like to talk a bit more about here.
